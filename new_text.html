    <q>
        D'you breathe the name of your saviour
        In your hour of need?
        And taste the blame if the flavor
        Should remind you of greed
        Of implication, insinuation, and ill-will
        'Til you cannot lie still
        In all this turmoil, before red cape and foil
        Come closing in for a kill
    </q>
    <p>From 'Carnival of Rust'</p>
    <p>by Poets of the Fall</p>
